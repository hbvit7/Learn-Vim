== Learn Vim (the Smart Way)

=== What’s This?

_Learn Vim (the Smart Way)_ is a guide to learn the good parts of Vim.

There are many places to learn Vim: the `vimtutor` is a great place to
start and the `help` manual has all the references you will ever need.
However, the average user needs something more than `vimtutor` and less
than the `help` manual. This guide attempts to bridge that gap by
highlighting only the key features to learn the most useful parts of Vim
in the least time possible.

This guide is written for both beginner and advanced Vimmers. It starts
out with broad and simple concepts and ends with specific and advanced
concepts. If you’re an advanced user already, I would encourage you to
read this guide from start to finish anyway, because you will learn
something new!
